# Alan De Luna - Computer Science Student at UCSD
Hello! My name is Alan De Luna, and I am a third-year student here at UCSD majoring in computer science. I'm originally from **Oceanside, CA**, and outside of technology, I love drawing and listening to rock and metal music!

### Academic Goals
I hope to graduate by 2026 and work full-time as a software engineer at a large technology company. I also hope to work as an artist on the side to achieve my goal of becoming an artist as well. I understand that this will be hard, but with enough perseverance, I can do it! Here is a check of where I'm at right now: 



### Favorite Quote
My favorite quote of all time has to be: 
> "Keep your hopes up high and your head down low" - A Day To Remember

A Day To Remember is one of my favorite rock bands from the 2000s and I also make sure to keep this quote with me.

### Favorite Programming Language 
My favorite programming languages are C++ and Python. Here's an example of printing "hello world!" in both languages: 
```
print('hello world) 
```

```
cout << "Hello World!" << endl; 
```
